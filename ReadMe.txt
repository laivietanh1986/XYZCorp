*Some key thing I have done :
1.remove all formater except Json => so that user must send request  header with content-type = application/json.
and the result will alway format with json media type. 
2.config helper page  so that api description will display in helper page . (could improve later with swagger package , now agree with microsoft solution ) 
3.write unit test for all method in service .
*Need to improve :
1. seperate layer of the api
2. user dependency injection 
3. user database to store data
